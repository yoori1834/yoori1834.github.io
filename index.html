To do list:
- make the buttons into images
- move the divs around so that they are evenly spaced square imgs
- make the buttons responsive (the page changes when clicked)
- make the buttons go to different responses (pages)
- make the background look much cooler (I WANT THE COLOR BLOBS!!!!!!!!!!! codepen.)
- maybe have the heading be a relaxing animation? pop up slowly?


To do next list:
- squish the divs around so they are evenly spaced square imgs
